The **Entity Component System (ECS)** pattern is widely used in [game development](https://terminalroot.com.br/tags#gamedev) and modular logic applications. It separates data (components), behavior (systems), and entities (IDs).

### Its structure can be summarized as:

* **Entity**: just an ID (e.g., `Player = 1`)
* **Component**: pure data (e.g., `Position`, `Velocity`, `Health`)
* **System**: logic that operates on entities with certain components (e.g., physics system uses `Position` and `Velocity`)

### Advantages:

* **Performance**: cache-friendly, contiguous memory access
* **Flexibility**: add/remove behaviors without inheritance or conditionals
* **Scalability**: easy to manage hundreds/thousands of entities
* **Organization**: clear separation of data and logic

### Simple example:

{% highlight cpp %}
struct Position { float x, y; };
struct Velocity { float dx, dy; };

for (auto entity : entities_with<Position, Velocity>()) {
    entity.Position.x += entity.Velocity.dx;
    entity.Position.y += entity.Velocity.dy;
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Common use cases:

* **Physics simulations**
* **Particle systems**
* **Entity-based AI**

Below is a list of the **12 best ECS libraries in [C++](https://terminalroot.com.br/tags#cpp)**, including descriptions, pros and cons, real project usage, and GitHub links.
