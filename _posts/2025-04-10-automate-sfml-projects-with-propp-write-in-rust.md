I had created an [application](https://terminalroot.com/automate-sfml-projects-with-propp/) that automatically generates [C++](https://terminalroot.com/tags#cpp) projects with [SFML](https://terminalroot.com/tags#sfml) and compiles them with the programming language I created: [Terlang](https://github.com/terroo/terlang).

For more information about this command, which is called `pro++`, [see this article](https://terminalroot.com/automate-sfml-projects-with-propp/).

This article contains the same code, but written in [Rust](https://terminalroot.com/tags#rust). We will see the files and, **at the end**, how to *download*, *compile* and *install* them on your system.
