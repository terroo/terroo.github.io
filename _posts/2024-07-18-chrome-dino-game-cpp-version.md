I made the [Google Chrome](https://terminalroot.com/tags#chrome) version of Dinosaur Game with [C++](https://terminalroot.com/tags#cpp) and [SFML](https://terminalroot.com/tags#sfml).

I added several details, such as:
+ Day and night effect;
+ Punctuation;
+ Clouds, SUN, Moon and stars;
+ And among others.

The game is available on GitHub and the video tutorial is available on Youtube, although the video language is Brazilian Portuguese. However, as C++ is universal, you can follow the steps easily.

In the worst case, use YouTube's automatic translator.
