ðŸ”Š In this video we create an Audio Spectrum with [C++](https://terminalroot.com/tags#cpp) and the libraries: [SFML](https://terminalroot.com/tags#sfml) and [FFTW](https://fftw.org), which is a C lib of [FFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform), which is considered one of the most important algorithms in the world.
