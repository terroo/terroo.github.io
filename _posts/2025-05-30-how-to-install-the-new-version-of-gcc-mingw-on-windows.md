We previously published a post about installing [GCC MinGW on Windows](https://terminalroot.com/how-to-install-gcc-gpp-mingw-on-windows/), but it has become outdated â€” it was the old version: ~~8.1.0~~.

In this short article, weâ€™ll see how to update or install it (if you havenâ€™t already) the easy way.

## Installation

### If you installed the version from the previous article

First, remove (or rename) the folder:

> Open [PowerShell](https://terminalroot.com.br/tags#powershell) with administrator privileges.

To rename:

{% highlight powershell %}
Rename-Item -Path "C:\mingw64" -NewName "mingw64-old"
{% endhighlight %}

Or to remove the installation:

{% highlight powershell %}
Remove-Item -Path "C:\mingw64" -Recurse -Force
{% endhighlight %}

### Now just download the compressed file from:

* [https://sourceforge.net/projects/winlibs-mingw/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winlibs-mingw/)

Or direct download:
[https://sourceforge.net/projects/winlibs-mingw/files/latest/download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winlibs-mingw/files/latest/download)

### Extract the file

If extracting it didnâ€™t create the `mingw32` folder, itâ€™s because itâ€™s inside the folder:
`winlibs-i686-mcf-dwarf-gcc-15.1.0-mingw-w64ucrt-12.0.0-r1/`.

Move it to drive `C:\`:

{% highlight powershell %}
Move-Item -Path "mingw32" -Destination "C:\"
{% endhighlight %}

Rename it to `mingw64`:

{% highlight powershell %}
Rename-Item -Path "C:\mingw32" -NewName "mingw64"
{% endhighlight %}

### Add to the `PATH` system variable

Do this only if this is your first installation. If youâ€™re updating from the previous articleâ€™s procedure, you donâ€™t need to.

> Open the [terminal](https://terminalroot.com.br/2025/05/personalize-seu-powershell-like-a-pro.html) with administrator privileges and run the command below:

{% highlight powershell %}
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";C:\mingw64", "Machine")
{% endhighlight %}

Now check the version by running:

> If this is your first installation, close and reopen the [terminal](https://terminalroot.com.br/2025/05/personalize-seu-powershell-like-a-pro.html)!

{% highlight powershell %}
g++ --version
{% endhighlight %}

> `15.1.0`

The full output will be:

{% highlight powershell %}
g++.exe (MinGW-W64 i686-ucrt-mcf-dwarf, built by Brecht Sanders, r1) 15.1.0
Copyright (C) 2025 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

{% endhighlight %}

This version is available at [https://winlibs.com](https://winlibs.com), which links to the same *SourceForge* page, but there are other versions there for different setups.

If you want to use the `make` command, remember to rename it from `C:\mingw64\bin\mingw32-make` to `C:\mingw64\bin\make`.

{% highlight powershell %}
Rename-Item -Path "C:\mingw64\bin\mingw32-make" -NewName "make"
{% endhighlight %}
