With [software development](https://terminalroot.com/tags#development) becoming increasingly complex, ensuring code quality and security is essential.

In languages such as [C](https://terminalroot.com/tags#linguagemc) and [C++](https://terminalroot.com/tags#cpp), which offer high performance but also require special care due to manual memory management and the possibility of subtle errors, the use of static analyzers has become an indispensable practice.

These tools help identify bugs, vulnerabilities and style issues even before the program is executed, saving time, effort and, most importantly, avoiding critical failures in production.

In this article, we present a list of 10 of the best static analyzers available for C and C++, highlighting their main features, advantages and usage scenarios. Whether you are an experienced developer or someone who is just starting out, knowing these tools will be an important differentiator to improve the quality of your code and reduce development risks.
