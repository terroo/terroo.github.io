**LazyDocker** is an open-source tool written in [Go](https://terminalroot.com.br/tags#go): a [TUI](https://terminalroot.com.br/tags#tui) application that simplifies managing [Docker](https://terminalroot.com.br/tags#docker) containers, images, volumes, and Docker-Compose services directly from the [terminal](https://terminalroot.com.br/tags#terminal), without needing to memorize complex commands.

Features:
* **Live logs and metrics**: Displays real-time logs and stats (CPU/memory) for containers.
* **Keyboard navigation**: Quick commands to move between containers and services.
* **Quick control**: Start, stop, restart, and remove containers with a click/keypress.
* **Docker Compose support**: Detects `docker-compose.yml` and allows managing services in one place.
* **Lightweight and visual interface**: Ideal for remote servers or terminal preferences.
* **Mouse support and customizable UI**: Supports mouse actions and configuration via YAML.

Benefits:
* Avoids memorizing complex Docker commands, streamlining your workflows.
* Useful for local development, microservices, debugging, and remote environments without a graphical interface.
* Lightweight, fast, and efficient compared to heavy GUIs.
