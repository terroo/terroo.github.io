After [ASML](https://www.asml.com/en) created **Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV)** machines, it became possible to develop chips *a thousand times smaller than a strand of hair*. This allows for billions of processing operations in a fraction of a second and enables more intensive work with [Big Data](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data).

This brought many *positive things*, but at the same time, it created a **major problem for various fields**, especially for [software development](https://terminalroot.com/tags#desenvolvimento).

The number of codes generated by [Artificial Intelligence](https://terminalroot.com/tags#ia) has caused many problems related to security, readability, and various other factors.

And among the technologies developed to avoid "*poorly made*" code, usually **PROCESSED by AI**, there is a website that detects it with **95% accuracy**.

This tool is: **AI Code Detector**.

## How does it work?
Simply go to: [https://code-detector.ai/](https://bit.ly/4mIfJ40) and then click the button: [Check your code](https://bit.ly/4pLnqcF) and paste the code you want to analyze.

Although the textarea for inserting code mentions [TypeScript](https://terminalroot.com/tags#typescript) or [Python](https://terminalroot.com/tags#python), it works for any programming language, but the code must have at least **100 lines**.

I asked an AI to generate a code with [C++](https://terminalroot.com/tags#cpp) and [OpenGL](https://terminalroot.com/tags#opengl) and after copying and pasting the code, the result detected that it was **100% AI-made code**, see:

Then, I took code written by me, which is part of the [Terlang](https://github.com/terroo/terlang) programming language, specifically [this file](https://github.com/terroo/terlang/blob/main/src/Ter.cpp), and asked AI Code Detector to check it. It concluded that **the code had nothing made by AI**, meaning **0%**:
