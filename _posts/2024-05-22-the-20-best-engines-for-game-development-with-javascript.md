I hope you liked this list!

If you want to learn [Game Development](https://terminalroot.com/tags#gamedev), I would recommend entering this world with [C++](https://terminalroot.com/tags#cpp), as it is easier to understand how everything works and then move on to [JavaScript](https://terminalroot.com/tags#javascript), if you're not already into that.

I've already made some games with JavaScript, one of them was [Gentoo Jump Game](https://github.com/terroo/gentoo-jump-game) a few years ago!

Play it now:
> Use **Mouse Click** to: **Start** and **Jump**(Once or several times)!
